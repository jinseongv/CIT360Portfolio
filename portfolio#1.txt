ICIT360Portfolio #101/23/2016Jinseong JeongObject and Class in JavaThese topics I have spent a lot of time typing to learn. These two topics was very basic and simple thing, but I have really tried to master because I am the beginning of Java. Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors -wagging, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class. A class can be defined as a template/blue print that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support.I also taught this topic to my team. You can find it in our community, Team 6 Community - CIT-360 Class - W16-02.My taught this again here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLpEXfVrCws my teaching starts at 31:10I taught to my team about modern software designs. First of all, I talked about what were the modern software designs and then showed them how to design on Android Studio.I learned about what was UML. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering, that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.
